function Calc_ExactResultspSW(Gamma, Tot_X_Pts, A, Exit_Pressure, Del_x)
    #CALC_EXACTRESULTSPSW assigns exact flow values when shock-wave present
    #   Calc_ExactResultspSW determines the exact values of the flow variables
    #       at all grid-points for 1D inviscid compressible flow through a 
    #       symmetric nozzle when a shock-wave is present. All flow variables 
    #       are dimensionless as in rest of simulation code. Formulas on which()
